Is a car leasing company allowed to share information about their customers' payment arrears with the intermediating dealers?,"The disclosure of information about customers' payment arrears by a car leasing company to intermediating dealers constitutes the processing of personal data and is therefore subject to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (1).

Such processing is only permissible if it is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, do not override (1.6).

Whether, in the specific case, there is a legitimate interest of the leasing company or the dealer, and whether this interest outweighs the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, is a question of the individual case. In this regard, the nature of the data, the context of the processing, and the potential impacts on the data subject must be taken into account.

It should be noted that the CJEU in its decision of June 17, 2021 (2) stated that the processing of personal data for the enforcement of intellectual property rights can generally be considered a legitimate interest within the meaning of (1) GDPR. Although this decision was made in a different context, it could potentially also apply to the enforcement of payment claims in a leasing relationship.

However, it must be emphasized that the disclosure of information about payment arrears to third parties always requires a careful balancing of the involved interests and is only permissible under strict observance of data protection regulations.",4,"The disclosure of information about customer payment arrears by a car leasing company to intermediary dealers constitutes the processing of personal data and is therefore subject to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (1).

The processing of personal data for the protection of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party is permissible, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject requiring protection of personal data do not prevail (1.6).

Whether the disclosure of information about payment arrears can be considered a legitimate interest of the leasing company depends on the specific circumstances of the individual case. A balance must be struck between the interests of the leasing company and the fundamental rights of the affected person.

It should be noted that the ECJ in its decision of 17.6.2021 (2) has stated that the processing of personal data for the enforcement of copyright can generally be considered a legitimate interest within the meaning of (1) GDPR. Although this case is not directly transferable to the situation of a car leasing company, it shows that the enforcement of contractual rights can be considered a legitimate interest.

However, it should be noted that the disclosure of information about payment arrears to third parties may be considered a disproportionate invasion of the privacy of the affected person. Therefore, the leasing company should undertake a careful consideration before disclosing such information and, if necessary, seek legal advice."
Under what conditions can the affected person request the deletion of their personal data?,"According to the GDPR (1), the data subject has the right to request the controller to delete personal data concerning them without undue delay if one of the following reasons applies:

a) The personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.

b) The data subject withdraws their consent on which the processing is based (1.6, 1.9), and there is no other legal basis for the processing.

c) The data subject objects to the processing (2.1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing (2.1).

d) The personal data have been unlawfully processed.

e) The deletion of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.

f) The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to (1.8).

However, there are exceptions to this right to erasure, for instance, when processing is necessary for exercising the right to freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (1).

The same principles apply to the processing of personal data by the bodies and institutions of the Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 (3).",5,"The data subject has the right, according to GDPR (1), to demand the immediate deletion of relevant personal data by the controller if one of the following reasons applies:

1. The personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
2. The data subject withdraws their consent, on which the processing was based (1.6, 1.9), and there is no other legal basis for the processing.
3. The data subject objects to the processing (2.1), and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing (2.1).
4. The personal data have been unlawfully processed.
5. The deletion of personal data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.
6. The personal data were collected in relation to services offered by the information society according to (1.8).

The same principles apply to the processing of personal data by the bodies and institutions of the Union under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 (3)."
What are the requirements for effective consent for data processing?,"An effective consent to data processing must be given voluntarily, for the specific case, in an informed manner, and unambiguously according to GDPR (1.4).

Consent must be voluntary, meaning that the data subject must have a genuine choice and control. Consent is not valid if the data subject does not have a real choice, feels pressured to consent, or suffers negative consequences if they do not consent (2).

Consent must be given for one or more specific purposes. Requiring consent to be for a 'specific' purpose aims to ensure a certain level of control and transparency for the data subject (2).

Consent must be given in an informed manner. This means that the data subject must be informed about the purpose of the data processing and their rights regarding data processing (2).

Consent must be given unambiguously, meaning it must be given through an active action or statement. It must be clear that the data subject has consented to this particular processing (2).",4,"An effective consent to data processing must meet the following requirements according to GDPR (1.4) and Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679 (2):

1. Voluntariness: Consent must be given voluntarily. The data subject must have a genuine choice and must not feel pressured to consent or suffer negative consequences if they do not consent. Consent is not voluntary if it is a non-negotiable part of terms and conditions or if the data subject cannot refuse or withdraw consent without disadvantages (2).

2. Specificity: Consent must be given for one or more specific purposes. The data subject must have a choice regarding each of these purposes. Requiring consent for a ""specific"" purpose aims to ensure a certain level of control and transparency for the data subject (2).

3. Informed: The data subject must give informed consent. This means that they must be informed about the purpose of the data processing and their rights regarding data processing (2).

4. Unambiguous: Consent must be given unambiguously. This means that consent must be given through an active action or statement by the data subject, clearly indicating their agreement to the specific processing. It must be evident that the data subject has consented to this particular processing (2)."
Is the employer allowed to ask whether an employee has been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2?,"The question of whether an employer is allowed to inquire about the vaccination status of their employees is legally contentious. According to Article 9 GDPR (1), the processing of health data is generally prohibited. An exception exists under GDPR (1.9) when processing is necessary for the exercise of rights under labor law. According to  BDSG (3), the processing of special categories of personal data for the purposes of employment relationships is permissible if it is necessary for the exercise of rights or the fulfillment of legal obligations under labor law.

According to IfSG (2.1), the employer may process personal data of an employee regarding their vaccination and serostatus to the extent necessary to fulfill obligations under IfSG (2.2) concerning transmissible diseases. However, this does not apply to diseases that can no longer be transmitted as part of guideline-compliant treatment according to the state of medical science.

There is debate over whether SARS-CoV-2 falls under this regulation. Some argue that processing vaccination status is necessary for the prevention and control of infectious diseases and may therefore be permissible. Others argue that processing vaccination status is not necessary as other measures for the prevention and control of infectious diseases are available.

Furthermore, inquiring about vaccination status could potentially violate the obligation to consider the interests of others under the German Civil Code (BGB) (4).

Overall, the legal situation is unclear, and it is advisable to seek legal advice on this matter.",4,"The question of whether the employer is permitted to inquire about the vaccination status is contentious. According to Article 9 GDPR (1), the processing of health data is generally prohibited. An exception exists if the data subject has explicitly consented or if the processing is necessary for the exercise of rights under labor law. According to the BDSG (3), the processing of special categories of personal data for employment purposes is permissible if it is necessary to exercise rights or fulfill legal obligations under labor law and there is no reason to believe that the data subject's legitimate interests override excluding the processing.

Under IfSG (2.1), the employer may process personal data regarding an employee's vaccination and serostatus to decide on the establishment or nature of employment if it is necessary to fulfill obligations under (2.2) concerning communicable diseases.

According to IfSG (2.3), the employer may process personal data concerning an employee's vaccination and serostatus regarding COVID-19 to decide on the establishment or nature of employment if necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the establishments and companies mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2.

However, it is disputed whether these regulations also apply to employers not falling under the establishments and companies mentioned in IfSG (2.4, 2.5). In this case, BGB (4) could be relevant, which obliges each party in a contractual relationship to consider the rights, legal interests, and interests of the other party.

Overall, whether the employer is allowed to inquire about vaccination status depends on the specific circumstances of the case and is not conclusively settled in law."
Does the consent of the data subject for data processing have to be provided in writing?,"The consent to data processing does not necessarily have to be in writing. According to Article 7 of the GDPR (1), however, the controller must be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to the processing of their personal data. In the context of the employment relationship, BDSG (2) provides that consent should be in writing or electronically, unless another form is appropriate due to special circumstances.",4,"The data subject's consent to data processing does not necessarily have to be in writing. However, according to Article 7 of the GDPR (1), the controller must be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to the processing of their personal data. A written consent can facilitate this proof. 

In the context of the employment relationship, BDSG (2) stipulates that consent must be in writing or electronically, unless another form is appropriate due to special circumstances. The employer must inform the employee about the purpose of data processing and their right to revoke consent under Article 7 paragraph 3 of the GDPR in written form (1.3). 

Thus, it is generally possible for consent to be provided in a form other than writing; however, the controller must be able to demonstrate in any case that valid consent has been obtained (1)."
On which storage media are employers allowed to store personal data?,"Personal data may be stored on any storage media, provided that the requirements of the GDPR and the BDSG are met. The GDPR defines data storage as a subset of data processing (1). 

For the purposes of the employment relationship, data may be processed if necessary for the performance or termination of the employment relationship, or for the exercise or fulfillment of rights and obligations arising from a law or a collective agreement (2). 

However, the GDPR requires appropriate technical and organizational measures to be taken to ensure an adequate level of protection. This includes pseudonymization and encryption of personal data, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of systems and services related to processing, and the ability to restore the availability of personal data and access to it in the event of a physical or technical incident (1). 

Therefore, it is not the storage medium itself that is crucial, but rather compliance with data protection requirements in the processing of data.",4,"The GDPR (1) and the BDSG (2) do not specify specific storage media on which personal data may be stored. Instead, they require the controller, in this case the employer, to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk (1.3). These measures include, among others, pseudonymization and encryption of personal data, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of systems and services related to processing, and the ability to restore the availability of personal data and access to it in the event of a physical or technical incident (1.3).

Data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship is permissible under BDSG (2.2) if necessary for the decision on the establishment of an employment relationship, for the performance or termination of the employment relationship, or for the exercise or fulfillment of the rights and obligations arising from a law or a collective agreement, a works agreement, or a service agreement of the employee representation (2.2).

In summary, the employer may store personal data on any storage medium as long as they comply with the requirements of the GDPR (1) and the BDSG (2)."
Can the employment contract of a data protection officer at a public institution be terminated if they fail to fulfill their duties as a data protection officer properly?,"According to § 6 paragraph 4 BDSG (1.6), the termination of the employment relationship of a data protection officer is prohibited, unless there are facts that justify the termination by the public authority for good cause without observing a notice period. Good cause exists if there are facts that, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of both parties to the contract, the terminating party cannot reasonably be expected to continue the employment relationship until the expiration of the notice period or until the agreed termination of the employment relationship (BGB (2)).

Whether the non-fulfillment of duties as a data protection officer constitutes such good cause depends on the specific circumstances of the individual case. It should be noted that termination can only occur within two weeks after the terminating party has become aware of the facts relevant to the termination (2).

In a judgment of the Federal Labor Court, an extraordinary termination of a data protection officer due to significant overtime leading to irregularities was deemed effective (3). However, it should be noted that this was based on the specific circumstances of the case and may not necessarily be applicable to other cases.",4,"According to § 6 (4) BDSG (1.6), termination of the employment relationship of a data protection officer is impermissible unless there are facts justifying termination without notice for good cause by the public entity. Good cause exists if there are facts based on which, considering all circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of both parties to the contract, it is unreasonable for the terminating party to continue the employment relationship until the expiration of the notice period or until the agreed termination of the employment relationship (BGB (2)).

Whether the failure to fulfill the duties as a data protection officer constitutes such good cause depends on the specific circumstances of the individual case. In particular, the severity and duration of the breach of duty, the impact of the breach of duty on the public entity, and the previous contractual loyalty of the data protection officer must be considered (2).

In a judgment of the Federal Labour Court dated December 13, 2018 (3), the extraordinary termination of a data protection officer due to significant overtime hours, which the data protection officer had self-approved, was deemed effective. This demonstrates that a data protection officer can also be terminated for serious breaches of duty.

However, whether the failure to fulfill the duties as a data protection officer constitutes such good cause can only be decided on a case-by-case basis. It is therefore advisable to seek legal advice in such a situation."
Is it permissible for a cookie banner to obscure the imprint?,"Service providers must keep certain information, including the imprint, easily identifiable, directly accessible, and constantly available (1). A cookie banner that obscures the imprint could violate these requirements as it could impair the direct accessibility and constant availability of the imprint. Therefore, a cookie banner should be designed in a way that it does not obscure the imprint.",5,"The information from the imprint must be easily recognizable, directly accessible, and permanently available (1). If a cookie banner obscures the imprint, the information contained therein is not easily accessible to the user. Therefore, the cookie banner must not obscure the imprint. Alternatively, a easily recognizable clickable link to the imprint may also be present in the cookie banner."
Does RoHS also apply to vehicles?,"The RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU generally applies to electrical and electronic equipment falling within the categories listed in Annex I. However, means of transport for the carriage of passengers or goods are exempt from this directive, with the exception of electric two-wheeled vehicles that are not type-approved (1). Therefore, the RoHS Directive does not apply to vehicles.",5,"No, not all vehicles are covered, because Directive 2011/65/EU states that the directive does not apply to 'vehicles designed for the transport of persons or goods, except for electric two-wheel vehicles that are not type-approved' (1). Thus, at least only the mentioned two-wheel vehicles fall under the directive."
Are delivery costs for a vehicle allowed to be included in a loan agreement?,"The inclusion of delivery costs for a vehicle in a loan agreement is generally permissible. According to the BGB, standard terms and conditions presented by one party to the other party when concluding a contract are permissible, provided they are not unusual or unfairly disadvantage the contracting party (1.1).

Provisions in standard terms and conditions that are so unusual that the contracting party of the user does not have to expect them are not part of the contract (1.1).

Provisions in standard terms and conditions are ineffective if they unreasonably disadvantage the contracting party of the user contrary to the principles of good faith (1.2).

In a judgment of the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) dated November 23, 2016, it was found that the standard transfer of costs for the delivery or registration and deregistration of the vehicle to the lessee does not constitute an unreasonable disadvantage (2).

Therefore, in my opinion, it is permissible to include delivery costs for a vehicle in a loan agreement, provided they are not unusual or unfairly disadvantage the contracting party.",4,"The inclusion of delivery costs for a vehicle in a loan agreement is generally permissible, provided they do not violate § 307 BGB, which states that provisions in standard terms and conditions are ineffective if they unreasonably disadvantage the contracting party of the user contrary to the principles of good faith [1].

In a judgment of the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) dated November 23, 2016, it was decided that the standard transfer of delivery and registration costs to the lessee does not constitute an unreasonable disadvantage within the meaning of § 307 (1) sentence 1 BGB (2).

However, it should be noted that the clause regulating the delivery costs must be prominently placed so as not to escape the attention of a normally attentive reader (2).

Furthermore, the delivery costs must not be so unusual that the contracting party of the user does not have to expect them, according to § 305c (1) BGB [1].

Overall, it can be said that the inclusion of delivery costs in a loan agreement is permissible, provided that the above-mentioned conditions are met."
What are reasons that justify the termination of an employment contract?,"According to § 626 of the German Civil Code (1), an employment contract can be terminated without notice for good cause, if there are facts that, considering all circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of both parties to the contract, make it unreasonable to expect the terminating party to continue the employment relationship until the end of the notice period or until the agreed termination of the employment relationship.

Good cause may, for example, lie in a breach of contractual duties, such as the refusal of a managing director to comply with shareholder instructions (2).

Another reason may be the violation of postal secrecy, as in the case of a works council chairperson who opened a letter addressed to the works council chairperson (3).

Good cause may also exist if the possibility of ordinary termination is excluded and this would result in the employer having to continue to pay the employee for significant periods without corresponding work being performed (3).

However, it is important to note that primarily it is a matter for the judge of fact to determine whether specific behavior qualifies as good cause for extraordinary termination (2).",3,"According to § 626 of the German Civil Code (1), an employment contract can be terminated without notice for good cause. Good cause exists if there are facts that, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of both parties to the contract, make it unreasonable to expect the terminating party to continue the employment relationship until the end of the notice period or until the agreed termination of the employment relationship.

Some examples of such reasons are:

1. The refusal of a managing director to comply with shareholder instructions may constitute a breach of contractual duties, justifying the immediate termination of the employment contract (2).

2. The violation of postal secrecy by a works council member may be considered a breach of duties arising from the employment relationship and thus constitute good cause for extraordinary termination (2).

3. In the case of a fixed-term employment contract that cannot be terminated under ordinary circumstances, extraordinary termination for operational reasons may be considered if the possibility of ordinary termination is excluded and this would result in the employer having to continue to pay the employee for significant periods without corresponding work being performed (3).

However, it is important to note that the assessment of whether specific behavior qualifies as good cause for extraordinary termination is a matter for the judge of fact and must be decided on a case-by-case basis (2)."
